Welcome to our site! We're just getting setup.

Primarily, Luma Group focuses on contributing to open source projects, our members have already contributed to many large projects including Chromium, Firefox and Flutter. Our memebers have made a combined total of over 2000 contributions in 2021 and we're on track to hit a similar number in 2022.

We're still in the process of setting up... our goal is to fund experienced developers to contribute to open source projects. If you feel like you'd like to join, please [email us](mailto:admin@luma-group.org). Please let us know if you have any prior open source contributions!

Luma Group is not available for freelance or consulting-based development. Please do not reach out with closed source projects seeking our contribution.
